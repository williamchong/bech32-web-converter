    "title": "What is a Bech32 Address Prefix?",
    "text": "Bech32 is an address format used by many blockchain networks, especially Cosmos-based chains. The prefix (like 'cosmos', 'osmo', 'juno') identifies which specific blockchain network the address belongs to. For example: 'cosmos1abc...' is a Cosmos Hub address, while 'osmo1abc...' is an Osmosis address. The part after the prefix contains the same underlying account information.",
